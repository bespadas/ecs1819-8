            <h3 style="color:white"> My mom and dad have always been complicated, and their "love story" isn't that exciting, but their journey here was. My parents came here illegally.. shocker.
            If you've see one of those mexican movies were they cross the border that was my father and mother story. They worked a lot at a young age. Years went by and my mother moved to work 
            at a factory with my uncle, they got really close, and he told her they had a buisness of driving people around sorta like a taxi, there is where my mom met my dad, she was a lot younger
            and my dad didn't really care about her. After my dads failed attempts at marriages with some other ladies he focused himself on my mom gross, right? They went out on a couple of dates
            they fell in love blah blah blah then my sister was born then me and that how my life began.   </h3>
